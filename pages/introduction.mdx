Find out all APIs at `API Refernces` tab.

### Authentication

When working with the API, you need to pass an `API Key` in header of all your requests. For example: `X-Api-Key <KEY>`

##### Obtaining the token

To get your Api Key, open the AML application, and log in. Once you are logged in, navigate to the `My Profile` under the Profile icon in the header. From here, you can get your API key.
